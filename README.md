# Install Android Studio

Android Studio provides a complete integrated development environment (IDE) including an advanced code editor and a set of app templates. In addition, it contains tools for development, debugging, testing, and performance that make it faster and easier to develop apps. You can test your apps with a large range of preconfigured emulators or on your own mobile device, build production apps, and publish on the Google Play store.
